### self
Experimental repository to test out efficiency of 
using a version control system on self improvement planning.  

#### Idea
Main idea is to create a config file with a set of small achievements that 
has to be completed in a period of time (2 weeks) and binded to a tag (0.0.1).  
For example:
```
# self 0.0.1
[Exercise]
* Go to the gym >=2 a week
  Status: []
* Run at >=2 a week > 10 min
  Status: []

[Reading]
* Read at >=30 min per day
  Status: []

[Studying]
* Study Dr. Chucks C course >=1 hour every workday
  Status: []
```
If the plan above will be completed 2 weeks straight, 
then it can be upgraded from version 0.0.1 to 0.0.2 and settings can be modified.
